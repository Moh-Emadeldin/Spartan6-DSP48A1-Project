# Spartan6 DSP48A1  Project

## Overview

This project is focused on utilizing the DSP48A1 block in Spartan6 for digital signal processing. The work includes code implementation, testbench, simulations, and various schematics.

## Features
DSP48A1 Primitive: Utilized for optimized arithmetic computations.

Directed Testbench: Designed to rigorously test DSP functionality.

Reg_Mux Combo: A smaller modular design for efficient register-multiplexer combination.

Do File: Automates simulation runs for easier verification.

Vivado Implementation: Synthesized and tested using Xilinx Vivado.

## Tools Used
Verilog for design and testbench.

Vivado for synthesis, implementation, and verification.

ModelSim/QuestaSim (if applicable) for simulation automation using .do files.
